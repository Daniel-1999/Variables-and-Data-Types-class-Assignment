### Assignment: Variables and Data Types

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to practice working with variables and data types in JavaScript. You will be given a set of tasks that involve declaring variables, assigning values, and performing operations using different data types.

Instructions:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your local development environment with your name example `Clifford.js`.
2. Complete the following tasks in the JavaScript file:
   - Declare three variables: `numOne`, `numTwo`, and `numThree`, and assign them values of your choice (numeric values).
   - Declare a variable `result` and calculate the sum of `numOne`, `numTwo`, and `numThree`. Print the result to the console.
   - Declare a variable `fullName` and assign it your full name as a string.
   - Declare a variable `age` and assign it your age as a number.
   - Declare a variable `isStudent` and assign it a boolean value representing whether you are a student or not.
   - Create an array `hobbies` and add at least three hobbies of your choice as string values.
   - Print the `fullName`, `age`, `isStudent`, and `hobbies` to the console.
3. Save the JavaScript file and test it by running it in a browser console or using a JavaScript runtime environment nodejs .
4. Once you have completed the assignment, push your code to the GitHub repository we have set up for our class.

Note: Feel free to add additional tasks or challenges to further explore variables and data types if you feel comfortable doing so.
